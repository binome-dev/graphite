A Node is a discrete component in a graph-based agent system that operates under an event-driven model. Its primary role is to represent its position within a workflow graph, manage event subscriptions, and designate topics for publishing. In addition, it delegates execution to a Command object, adhering to the Command Pattern. Each Node comprises the following elements:

- Unique Identity
  - Distinguished by a unique node_id, name, and type.
  - The name must be unique within a given workflow.
- Subscribed Topics
  - Stores the event topics to which the node subscribes, typically originating from upstream publishers.
  - Subscriptions can reference explicit topic names or apply custom subscription strategies.
- Publish-To Topics
  - Stores the event topics designated for downstream nodes to subscribe to, facilitating event routing.
- Command for Execution
  - Encapsulates execution logic through a Command object.
  - Allows integration of new or specialized commands without modifying the node’s existing structure.

Node includes the `can_execute()` method, which determines whether the Node is ready for execution based on the availability of events in subscribed topics.

The following table describes each field within the Node class, highlighting its purpose and usage in the workflow:

| Field                    | Description                                                       |
