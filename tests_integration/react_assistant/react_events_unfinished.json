However, to provide a precise answer, I would need to confirm the specific areas that are considered part of the eastern sector of the orogeny.\\n\\nSince I do not have enough detailed data on the exact boundaries or specific elevations associated with the eastern sector, the next logical step is to look up the specific geographical data or geological maps that outline this area and its elevation profile. \\n\\nTherefore, I will gather more specific information about the geographic boundaries and exact elevations related to the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny to provide a complete answer.\", \"refusal\": null, \"annotations\": [], \"audio\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"tool_call_id\": null, \"tools\": [{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"web_search_using_tavily\", \"description\": \"Function to search online given a query using the Tavily API.
